# Angular Gitlab Heroku example

Example project that illustrates how to prepare a generated Angular app and deploy it to [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

The example app is [available on Heroku](https://angular-gitlab-heroku.herokuapp.com/).

## Required

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed

## Running in production mode on localhost

When you start your application during development using `ng serve`, your Angular app runs in development mode. Angular starts a small webserver, serves your app, and watches for code changes.

When you deploy your application to an online cloud provider, your app runs in production mode. You do not use `ng serve` then but you must provide your own webserver that hosts your application. In our case, this webserver is realized in the `\src\server.js` file. Angular provides the `ng build` command to build a production version of your app. The production release, an efficient and minimized version of your application, is placed in the `/dist` folder. When de user navigates to the URL that is linked to your online deployed webserver, the app is downloaded from the `/dist` folder to the user's browser and started.

To verify that everything works in production mode, you can build and run your production-ready application on localhost using the following commands.

```
ng build --aot
node src\server.js  // of npm start
```

Check [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see if your application runs as expected.

## Creating an app on Heroku

To deploy your app to Heroku, do the following:

- Navigate to [http://www.heroku.com](http://www.heroku.com) and create a new app.
- In your GitLab project settings, create two environment variables to connect your project to Heroku. These values are being used in the [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/avans-informatica-breda/programmeren/clientside-frameworks/angular-gitlab-heroku/blob/development/.gitlab-ci.yml#L67) file to connect your GitLab project to your Heroku account.
  - `HEROKU_APP_NAME` holds the Heroku name of your app (the first part of the URL that points to your online application)
  - `HEROKU_API_KEY` holds the API key that you find in your [Heroku Account settings](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account)
- Perform a `git push` to trigger a GitLab CI/CD pipeline build.

If all is well - which means your tests succeed and your app has been built in production mode - your app is available on Heroku.

## More Actions

Some more options on this project:

### Run Prettier on all files

Prettyfies your code.

```
npm run pretty
```

### Run tslint

Validates the coding style of your files.

```
npm run lint
```

### Run Sonar scan

Scans your files and gathers Sonar metrics. See the results at [Avans SonarQube](https://sonarqube.avans-informatica-breda.nl/dashboard?id=angular-gitlab-heroku).
Check the [sonar-project.properties](https://gitlab.com/avans-informatica-breda/programmeren/clientside-frameworks/angular-gitlab-heroku/blob/master/sonar-project.properties) file and provide the required environment variables `SONAR_LOGIN_KEY` and `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY`. You'll find these in your online SonarQube project configuration. You can add your own environment variables in the same way if needed.

```
npm test
npm run sonar
```

## Troubleshooting

To inspect the logging on Heroku, install the [Heroku Command Line Interface](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), log in, and type

```
heroku logs --tail
```

Type `Ctrl+C` to stop.
